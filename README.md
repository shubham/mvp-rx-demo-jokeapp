# mvp-rx-demo-jokeapp

creating Demo Peoject for using Dagger 2 with MVP design pattern along with Rx java

in this project i'm using the Chris norris jokes free api(https://api.chucknorris.io/)

testing git commands
1) adding in readme and committing from different branch and merging back in to master 
2) then in local try with git pull with rebase and push some changes

trying some thing new :
I have taken a branch(Branch A) from Master and done some commits on the Branch A, in the meantime, some Commits are merged on Master from Another Branch B 
Problem is: I have to Push my commits and Merge to Master so which approach will be best :

1)I Push My commits to remote Branch A, then checkout master, then take a pull and then merge the Branch A in master and Push the merged code in Master.

2)I check out master and git pull with rebasing the master and then Checkout Branch A and Push my commits to Branch A and then Checkout Master and merge Branch A in Master and Push the Master.



Trying creating a new Branch feature/test 

1) will do some edit in Readme file and in local feature/test branch will add some some files
2)will commit and push readme file in Master
3)Will commit new file in feature/test branch, no push 
4) then i will checkout to master and then do a git pull --rebase will see what happen after that
5) after that merge the feature/test branch in develop and master 
6) push both bracnches
let's sse hwat happpens


testing

testign without merging the master into feature/test ,
after git pull --rebase then i will just merge the branch feature/test and then push the master


teting again pull-rebase before pushing but after merging feature/test-2 branch
in master
